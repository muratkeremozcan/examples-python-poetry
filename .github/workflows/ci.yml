# Using python -m mypy instead of direct mypy command ensures the tool is run
# through the Python interpreter installed in the current environment, avoiding path resolution issues.
# This approach guarantees that the correct version of mypy is used and that it's properly found
# even if the executable isn't directly in the system PATH
